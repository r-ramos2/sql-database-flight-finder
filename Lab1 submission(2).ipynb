Place any testing cells after the ending cell.\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Submission Instructions:\n 1. Commit your changes to your local repository.\n 2. Push your changes to the remote repository in Git Classroom.\n 3. Print your notebook as a PDF document and submit the PDF in Moodle.\n    * Do _NOT_ submit your iPython notebook -- instead, you should submit a PDF. \n    * To create a PDF from your notebook takes two steps:\n        1 select `File` -> `Export Notebook As..` -> `HTML`,\n        2 open the HTML document in a browser and print it to a PDF file.\n\nIf you run into problems with a query taking a very very long time, first try `Kernel` -> `Restart All and Run All Cells..` and then ask on Piazza\n\n###  _Have fun!_\n<hr>",

I'd like to know: if my plane is delayed in taking off, how will it affect my arrival time?\n\nThe [sample covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance) provides a measure of the joint variability of two variables. The higher the covariance, the more the two variables behave similarly, and negative covariance indicates the variables indicate the variables tend to be inversely related. We can compute the sample covariance as:\n$$\nCov(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ denotes the $i$th sample of $X$, $y_i$ the $i$th sample of $Y$, and the mean of $X$ and $Y$ are denoted by $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$.\n\nIn the cell below, write a single SQL query that computes the covariance between the departure delay time and the arrival delay time. You should explicitly exclude entries where either the arrival or departure delay is NULL.\n\n*Note: we could also compute a statistic like the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) here, which provides a normalized measure (i.e., on a scale from -1 to 1) of how strongly two variables are related. However, sqlite doesn't natively support square roots (unlike commonly-used relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL!), so we're asking you to compute covariance instead.*",
